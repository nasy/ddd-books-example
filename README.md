HA Domain Driven Design
========================

1) What is DDD
2) What is Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
3) Why is it good?

    - Clean Architecture = Easy and quick to maintain
    - Clean Code = Less bugs = Happy clients
    - Framework independent  = Easy to switch frameworks/trends
    - Standardised structure across projects = Easy work multiple projects
    - Industry best practice = Well recognition in the community
    
    Spaghetti -> MVC -> Clean Architecture (Not always necessary)

4) Layers of HA (Picture)
5) Elements of HA

    - Entities
    - Repositories
    - Services -> Internal libraries that we can inject
    - Use Cases
    - Value Objects
    
    - Aggregates (Advanced)
    - Domain Events (Advanced)

6) Services Vs Use Cases
7) Create book example (Entity private properties)
9) Switching Email Providers Case
10) Update book example (Value Objects)
11) Decoupled (Easy to test) (Coverage %)
12  Why Active Record is not good for HA
12) Aggregates (Multiple objects involved)
13) Domain Events (Advanced, similar to Angular Events)
