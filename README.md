A Small Fun Demo Using Domain Driven Design Folder Structure
========================

This project has a simple DDD and Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) architecture.
Why is it good to use Hexagonal Architecture?

    - Clean Architecture = Easy and quick to maintain
    - Clean Code = Less bugs = Happy clients
    - Framework independent  = Easy to switch frameworks/trends
    - Standardised structure across projects = Easy work multiple projects
    - Industry best practice = Well recognition in the community
    
Elements of HA

    - Entities
    - Repositories
    - Services -> Internal libraries that we can inject
    - Use Cases
    - Value Objects
    
    - Aggregates (Advanced)
    - Domain Events (Advanced)
    
    
    No further documentation is provided as this project does not run, it's purpose it's to demo the layers and folder structure involved.
